## Reinforcement Learning Environments

```python
classVecEnvBase(
    headless: bool, 
    sim_device: int = 0, 
    enable_livestream: bool = False, 
    enable_viewport: bool = False, 
    launch_simulation_app: bool = True, 
    experience: Optional[str] = None
)
```

This class provides a base interface for connecting RL policies with task implementations. APIs provided in this interface follow the interface in gym.Env. This class also provides utilities for initializing simulation apps, creating the World, and registering a task.

- VecEnvBase: A base class that provides an interface for connecting RL policies with task implementations, following the gym.Env interface. It handles simulation initialization, task registration, and basic environment interactions like reset, step, and render.
- TaskStopException: An exception class used to signal task termination.
- TrainerMT: An abstract base class for controlling the start and stop of an RL policy.
- VecEnvMT: A multi-threaded environment wrapper that separates the RL policy execution and simulation tasks into different threads, enabling interaction with the UI during RL training. It uses message queues for inter-thread communication, managing the flow of actions from the policy to the task, and data from the task to the policy.

The code provides methods for setting up the simulation environment, initializing tasks, stepping through the simulation, rendering, resetting the environment, and handling actions and observations. It supports both single-threaded and multi-threaded modes of operation, with the multi-threaded mode allowing for UI interaction during training.
The classes are designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for the integration of different tasks and RL algorithms into the Isaac Sim framework.
